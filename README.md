## Origin

I developed this app as a project to deepen my understanding of the React framework. Throughout the process, I gained hands-on experience with essential React features, including the implementation of hooks for managing state and lifecycle events, and the use of React Router for efficient navigation. Additionally, I explored various techniques for handling props to enhance component interactions. To extend the app's functionality, I successfully integrated the [Financial Modeling API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs), enabling real-time access to comprehensive financial data.

## Current Features

 * Search and Portfolio Functionality:
   * Ability to add and delete stocks from portfolio.
   * Search for stocks on the market. 
 * Pleasant Company Data UI Experience:
   * Company profile in a glance
   * Access to easily readable income statement, cashflow statement and balance sheet
   * Annual report direct access from the Securities Exchange Commission website  

<!-- * Seeds database with sample data to demonstrate app's key features. -->

## Intended Improvements

Going forward, I would like to incorporate persistent portfolio and comment functionality, as well as access to data from the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
